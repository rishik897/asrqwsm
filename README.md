SOST20131- Building &amp; Constructing Statistical Models to Answer Research Questions
In my second year at the University of Manchester I took the module "Answering Social Research Questions With Statistical Models."  This course honed my ability in developed linear and logistic regression models. 
I was also introduced to the use of directed acylic graphs (DAGs) in evaluating proposed causal relationships.
